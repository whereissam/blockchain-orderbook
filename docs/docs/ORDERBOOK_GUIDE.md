# 📊 How Your Orderbook Works - Complete Guide

Your orderbook is now **live on Base Sepolia** with real tokens! Here's how it works:

## 🎯 Deployed Contracts (Base Sepolia)

- **SSS Token**: `0x4cC9e56C00a7b94424D94231bF5B603a32a0BF6D`
- **mETH Token**: `0xe6f9D40767Db3D90ac878228ABf407C675de1ba5`
- **Exchange**: `0x43d827e34D3e98F987075a469C513f8b8bA28a26`
- **Explorer**: https://sepolia.basescan.org/

- [mETH Token Contract](https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0xe6f9D40767Db3D90ac878228ABf407C675de1ba5)
- [Exchange Contract](https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0x43d827e34D3e98F987075a469C513f8b8bA28a26)

## 🏗️ Orderbook Architecture

### 1. **Token Contracts** 
```solidity
// Each token (SSS, mETH, mDAI) is an ERC20 contract
- name: "Super Sonic Speed Token" 
- symbol: "SSS"
- totalSupply: 1,000,000,000 tokens
- Standard transfer/approve functionality
```

### 2. **Exchange Contract**
```solidity
// Central orderbook that handles all trading
- Deposit tokens to exchange
- Place buy/sell orders  
- Match orders automatically
- Withdraw tokens back to wallet
```

## 📝 How Trading Works

### Step 1: Deposit Tokens
```
User → Approve tokens → Exchange holds tokens → Ready to trade
```

### Step 2: Create Orders
**Buy Order**: "I want to buy 100 SSS for 0.1 mETH each"
**Sell Order**: "I want to sell 100 SSS for 0.12 mETH each"

### Step 3: Order Matching
When compatible orders exist, they execute automatically:
```
Buy Order:  100 SSS at 0.12 mETH each (willing to pay up to 0.12)
Sell Order: 100 SSS at 0.10 mETH each (willing to sell for 0.10)
✅ MATCH! Trade executes at 0.10 mETH
```

## 🎮 How to Use Your Orderbook

### Method 1: Using MetaMask + Frontend

1. **Configure MetaMask for Base Sepolia:**
   - Network: Base Sepolia
   - RPC: https://sepolia.base.org  
   - Chain ID: 84532

2. **Get Base Sepolia ETH:**
   - Visit: https://www.coinbase.com/faucets/base-ethereum-goerli-faucet

3. **Access the UI:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev  # Start frontend
   ```
   - Connect wallet
   - You'll see SSS/mETH trading pair
   - Deposit tokens to start trading

### Method 2: Direct Contract Interaction

You can also interact directly with the contracts:

```bash
# Using cast (Foundry's CLI tool)

# Check SSS token balance
cast call 0x4cC9e56C00a7b94424D94231bF5B603a32a0BF6D \
  "balanceOf(address)" YOUR_ADDRESS \
  --rpc-url https://sepolia.base.org

# Deposit SSS tokens to exchange  
cast send 0x43d827e34D3e98F987075a469C513f8b8bA28a26 \
  "depositToken(address,uint256)" \
  0x4cC9e56C00a7b94424D94231bF5B603a32a0BF6D 1000000000000000000 \
  --private-key YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY \
  --rpc-url https://sepolia.base.org
```

## 📊 Orderbook Components

### 1. **Buy Orders (Bids)**
```
Price (mETH) | Amount (SSS) | Total (mETH)
0.120        | 100          | 12.0
0.115        | 200          | 23.0  
0.110        | 150          | 16.5
```

### 2. **Sell Orders (Asks)**  
```
Price (mETH) | Amount (SSS) | Total (mETH)
0.125        | 80           | 10.0
0.130        | 120          | 15.6
0.135        | 200          | 27.0
```

### 3. **Order Matching Engine**
- **Best Bid**: Highest buy price (0.120 mETH)
- **Best Ask**: Lowest sell price (0.125 mETH)  
- **Spread**: 0.005 mETH (difference between bid/ask)
- **When spread closes**: Orders execute automatically!

## 🔄 Order Lifecycle

1. **Create Order**
   ```
   User creates: "Buy 100 SSS at 0.12 mETH each"
   Status: Open
   ```

2. **Order in Book**
   ```
   Order sits in orderbook waiting for match
   Status: Pending
   ```

3. **Partial Fill**
   ```
   Someone sells 50 SSS at 0.12 mETH
   Order becomes: "Buy 50 SSS at 0.12 mETH each" (remaining)
   Status: Partially Filled
   ```

4. **Complete Fill**  
   ```
   Someone sells remaining 50 SSS
   Status: Filled
   ```
